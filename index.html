        <p class="lead">
          The human mind is the single most powerful entity in the universe. Yet we have made no progress in our efforts to simulate it as <em>artificial general intelligence</em>. Why is that?
        </p>
        <p>
          In this captivating book, software engineer and philosopher Dennis Hackethal explains the mistakes intelligence researchers have been making – and how to fix them. Based out of Silicon Valley, he proposes a research program for building truly intelligent software, while arguing for a fundamental unification of software engineering and reason generally. Building on the theory of evolution, epistemology, psychotherapy, and astronomy, Hackethal presents a bold new explanation of how people evolved and provides unparalleled insight into the unlimited potential of artificial general intelligence that may one day take us to the stars.
